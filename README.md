# VisibooksScripts
Scripts from CS491 Unity VR project.

Using Google Cardboard SDK v0.6, the Visibooks Android application allows for users to view 
a fully animated 3D rendering of a scene from a book. The scripts for the various movement and text
control were written in C#.  Assets used include free assets from the Unity store along with custom built
objects.  This application was for demonstration purposes only and is not a finalized version.
